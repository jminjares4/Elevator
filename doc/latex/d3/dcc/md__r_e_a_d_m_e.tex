(See the \mbox{\hyperlink{_r_e_a_d_m_e_8md}{README.\+md}} file in the upper level \textquotesingle{}examples\textquotesingle{} directory for more information about examples.)

This is the simplest buildable example. The example is used by command {\ttfamily idf.\+py create-\/project} that copies the project to user specified path and set it\textquotesingle{}s name. For more information follow the \href{https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-guides/build-system.html\#start-a-new-project}{\texttt{ docs page}}\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysection{How to use example}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md12}
We encourage the users to use the example as a template for the new projects. A recommended way is to follow the instructions on a \href{https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/api-guides/build-system.html\#start-a-new-project}{\texttt{ docs page}}.\hypertarget{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysection{Example folder contents}\label{md__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md13}
The project {\bfseries{sample\+\_\+project}} contains one source file in C language \href{main/main.c}{\texttt{ main.\+c}}. The file is located in folder \mbox{[}main\mbox{]}(main).

ESP-\/\+IDF projects are built using CMake. The project build configuration is contained in {\ttfamily CMake\+Lists.\+txt} files that provide set of directives and instructions describing the project\textquotesingle{}s source files and targets (executable, library, or both).

Below is short explanation of remaining files in the project folder.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{├── CMakeLists.txt}
\DoxyCodeLine{├── main}
\DoxyCodeLine{│   ├── CMakeLists.txt}
\DoxyCodeLine{│   └── main.c}
\DoxyCodeLine{└── README.md                  This is the file you are currently reading}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Additionally, the sample project contains Makefile and component.\+mk files, used for the legacy Make based build system. They are not used or needed when building with CMake and idf.\+py.
